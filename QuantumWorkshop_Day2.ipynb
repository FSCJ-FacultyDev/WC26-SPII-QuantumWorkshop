For a single qubit, there are two possible outcomes (0 and 1), each associated with a complex amplitude. These amplitudes determine the probabilities of measurement and can be represented in algebraic form within the table.\n","\n","A quantum state’s amplitudes are complex numbers that have both magnitude and direction (phase). The magnitude determines measurement probability, while the direction influences how states interfere during computation. The squared magnitudes must sum to 1, and these values can be visualized in state tables using bars whose length represents magnitude and color represents direction.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aw8Hn2FGGtxr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Multi-Qubit Systems and Entanglement\n","\n","When we move from a single qubit to multi-qubit systems, the state space grows exponentially: two qubits can represent four basis states, three qubits represent eight, and so on.\n","- Unlike classical bits, qubits can become entangled, meaning their states cannot be described independently of one another.\n","  - this is where quantum computing stops being “probability with fancy math” and becomes fundamentally different from classical systems.\n","\n","### Separable Qubits\n","\n","- In classical systems, if you have two bits:\n","\n","    bit A = 0\n","\n","    bit B = 1\n","\n","  you can fully describe the system by describing each bit separately.\n","- Even if they are correlated (for example, always opposite), you can still describe them independently:\n","\n","    “B is the opposite of A.”\n","\n","- Two qubits are **separable** when each one has its own individual state, and the overall system is just those two states considered together.\n","\n","  Qubit A has its own condition.\n","\n","  Qubit B has its own condition.\n","\n","- Nothing special ties them together beyond being part of the same system.\n","- For example, if one qubit is in a superposition and the other is just in state 0, there is no deep connection between them — knowing everything about one tells you nothing new about the other.\n","\n","### Entangled State\n","\n","- In an entangled system, measuring one qubit immediately determines the correlated outcome of the other, even though neither qubit had a definite value before measurement.\n","- Consider a special two-qubit state where the pair is perfectly linked: whenever you measure them, they always match — both 0 or both 1 — but before measurement neither one has a definite value.\n","- In this situation, you cannot describe qubit A by itself and qubit B by itself and then simply combine those descriptions.
