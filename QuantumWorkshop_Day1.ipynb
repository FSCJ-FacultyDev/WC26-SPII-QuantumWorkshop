        "Quantum mechanics principles are essential for constructing quantum hardware, but they are not the primary focus when learning quantum computing concepts.\n",

        "In this exercise, we will visualize a single qubit as a mathematical state and observe how it changes under simple quantum operations. Rather than focusing entirely on physical hardware, we will start with conceptual and mathematical representations. The goal is to connect the conceptual ideas discussed earlier to concrete representations, showing how quantum states evolve and why repeated measurements are necessary to understand their statistical behavior.\n",
