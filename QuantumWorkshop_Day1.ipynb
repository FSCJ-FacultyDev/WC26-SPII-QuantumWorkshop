        "- Quantum computers resemble copper chandeliers because their design supports the extreme cooling and shielding required for superconducting qubits.\n",
        "- Cryogenic cooling to millikelvin temperatures (20–100 mK) is essential for superconducting qubits; even tiny amounts of thermal energy cause decoherence (the loss quantum state from environmental disturbance) and computational errors.\n",
        "- At near-absolute-zero temperatures, materials become superconducting with zero electrical resistance, which enables key quantum computing techniques and preserves coherence.\n",
        "- Suspending quantum computers from the ceiling reduces ground-borne mechanical vibrations that could disturb fragile qubit states, creating a more stable operating environment.\n",
        "- A \"chandelier-style\" vertical design improves thermal isolation, maintains ultra-low temperatures, and allows efficient organization of cryogenic stages and wiring for easier maintenance."
