        "\n",
        "- Quantum mechanics principles are essential for constructing quantum hardware, but they are not the primary focus when developing quantum software.\n",
        "- Instead, quantum programming emphasizes mathematical models, algorithms, and software tools that abstract away the underlying physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "While you don’t need deep physics to program quantum computers, understanding the following idea can help explain why quantum programs behave differently from classical ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. **Superposition:** a quantum system can exist in multiple  states at the same time (e.g., both 0 and 1). This is what allows quantum computers to process many possibilities simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The \"double-slit experiment\" (Thomas Young, 1801) demonstrates quantum superposition by showing that a particle exists in multiple possible paths simultaneously until it is measured.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ![DoubleSlit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FSCJ-FacultyDev/WC26-SPII-QuantumWorkshop/main/images/double-slit.png)\n",
        "<div align=\"center\"><i>Double-Slit Experiment (ScientificGamer, 2012)</i></div>\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. **Measurement:** observing a quantum system forces it to “choose” one outcome from many possibilities. This is why auantum results are inherently uncertain, which is why programs must be run many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. **Entanglement:** Two or more qubits can become entangled (linked) so that changing one affects the others instantly.This is what enables conditional logic and multi-qubit operations; essential for real computation.\n",
        "\n",
        " ![Entanglement](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/styles/2800_x_2800_limit/public/images/2025/03/18/Quantum-Entanglement-Final-sm.gif?itok=dEr5dKgA)\n",
        " - A pair of particles start out each in a quantum superposition of energy state 0 and energy state 1. Because the particles are also entangled with each other, when one is measured (represented by a ruler), both must randomly “collapse” such that one is fully in state 0 and the other is fully in state 1. The collapse is instantaneous for both particles, no matter how far apart they are. (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2025)\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. **Probability Distributions:** quantum results follow probability patterns rather than fixed outputs.This means that programmers interpret results statistically, not as single correct answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. **Noise:** real quantum systems are affected by environmental interference. This is why results are imperfect and why error mitigation is needed."

        "\n",
        "3. **Shot:** A single execution of a quantum circuit that produces one  outcome. Because results are probabilistic, many shots are run to estimate the full probability distribution of possible outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Quantum State:** A mathematical description of a quantum system that encodes all possible outcomes of a computation, along with their probabilities and relative phase (direction) information.\n",
