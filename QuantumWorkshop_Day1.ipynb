        "While you don’t need deep physics to program quantum computers, understanding the following idea can help explain why quantum programs behave differently from classical ones:\n",

        "1. **Superposition:** a quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time (e.g., both 0 and 1). This is what allows quantum computers to process many possibilities simultaneously.\n",

        "2. **Measurement:** observing a quantum system forces it to “choose” one outcome from many possibilities. This is why auantum results are inherently uncertain, which is why programs must be run many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Entanglement:** Two or more qubits can become entangled (linked) so that changing one affects the others instantly. This enables conditional logic and coordinated multi-qubit operations, which are essential for real quantum computation.  \n",
